# Java Coding Journey

Welcome to my **Java Coding Journey**! This repository showcases my progress as I learn Java and solve coding problems from basic to advanced levels. I track my problem-solving skills, logic development, and Java knowledge through this journey.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: VS Code
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
- **Tools**: JDK (Java Development Kit)

## üß© Problem-Solving Categories

I focus on solving Java problems in the following areas:

- **Pattern Problems**: Generating and manipulating patterns.
- **Basic Problems**: Fundamental programming challenges.
- **Number Problems**: Mathematical computations and logic-building.
- **Array Problems**: Working with arrays, sorting, searching, and manipulation.
- **String Problems**: String operations, transformations, and optimizations.
- **Recursion Problems**: Solving problems using recursive approaches.
- **OOP Problems**: Object-oriented design, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Advanced Java Problems**: Multithreading, streams, exception handling, and more.

This structured approach helps me strengthen problem-solving skills while mastering Java concepts through hands-on coding.
